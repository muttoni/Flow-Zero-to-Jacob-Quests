1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars? 

- resource oriented programming
- safety and security
- clarity and readability
- approachability
- developer ergonomics (aka experience)


2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

Due to the nature of smart contracts, this is code that executes *autonomously* , meaning a lingering bug can cause devastating effects (think of all the solidity hacks that caused hundreds of millions of dollars to be siphoned off). Readability, approachability makes it easier to spot bugs, safety and security (and resource oriented programming) makes it easier to *avoid* bugs/leaks and developer ergonomics just provides a joyful experience.
