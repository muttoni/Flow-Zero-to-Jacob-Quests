You are free to answer these questions in your own language of choice. And no, I don't mean computer programming language, haha.

1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

The blockchain is an immutable ledger that everyone can read from and write to (as long as there is consesus). 

2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts

A smart contract is a block of code that lives in the blockchain. It benefits from the self-immutability and public availability by living on the blockchain itself, while having infinite use-cases thanks to being able to mutate the blockchain programmatically. In other words, programming logic can be executed completely decentralized and autonomously.

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

A script queries the blockchain, a transaction mutates the blockchain (therefore involves consensus and usually tx fees)
